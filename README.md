# UkulimaUsoni_AgriBI_system
My fourth-year project utilizes Microsoft Azure and Power BI to develop an agri-business intelligence system. 
Ukulima Sahihi leverages a combination of data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence technologies to deliver predictive agricultural insights. The system was developed using Python. The Python libraries utilised are such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn for data cleaning, transformation, and predictive modeling of weather and market prices. Interactive dashboards were built using Microsoft Power BI to visualize trends, forecasts, and key performance indicators for farmers and stakeholders. The solution architecture and system workflows were designed using tools such as Draw.io and Figma, while cloud-based services employed include Azure ML where applicable supported model deployment and scalability.
